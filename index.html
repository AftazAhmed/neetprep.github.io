While microbes cause diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, and typhoid, several microbes are useful to humans in diverse ways.<br><br>2. Microbes or products derived from them are used in everyday life including household products.<br><br>3. A common example of microbial application is production of curd from milk.<br><br>4. Lactobacillus and several other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it to curd.<br><br>5. During growth, LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest the milk proteins.<br><br>6. A small amount of curd added to fresh milk as inoculum or starter contains millions of LAB.<br><br>7. At suitable temperature, LAB multiply and convert milk into curd.<br><br>8. Curd improves nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B12 content.<br><br>9. In the stomach, LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-causing microbes.<br><br>10. Dough used for making bread is fermented using bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br><br>11. During fermentation of bread dough, CO2 is produced which gives the puffed-up appearance.<br><br>12. Gas bubbles of CO2 are trapped in dough causing it to rise.<br><br>13. Dough used for making dosa and idli are fermented by bacteria.<br><br>14. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to production of CO2 gas.<br><br>15. Traditional drinks and foods are made by fermentation using microbes.<br><br>16. Toddy is a traditional drink of some parts of southern India made by fermenting sap from palms.<br><br>17. Cheese is one of the oldest food items in which microbes were used to process and preserve milk.<br><br>18. Cheese is made more nutritious and delicious by microbial action.<br><br>19. Different varieties of cheese are known by their characteristic texture, flavour and taste.<br><br>20. The specificity of cheese characteristics comes from the specific microbes used.<br><br>21.

Antibiotics are substances produced by bacteria and fungi.<br><br>11. Antibiotics are capable of killing or inhibiting growth of other disease-causing microbes.<br><br>12. Antibiotics are regarded as one of the most significant discoveries of the twentieth century.<br><br>13. Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered and it was a chance discovery.<br><br>14. Alexander Fleming was working on Staphylococci bacteria when he discovered penicillin.<br><br>15. Penicillium notatum is a mould that grew accidentally in Flemings unwashed culture plate.<br><br>16. Penicillium notatum inhibited the growth of Staphylococci bacteria.<br><br>17. Fleming concluded that the mould produces a chemical that inhibits bacterial growth.<br><br>18. Fleming named the chemical penicillin after the mould Penicillium notatum.<br><br>19. The full potential of penicillin as an effective antibiotic was established by Florey and Chain during World War II in 1938-40.<br><br>20. Penicillin was used for treating American soldiers during World War II.<br><br>21. Fleming, Florey and Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945 for penicillin discovery.<br><br>22. After Penicillin, other antibiotics were isolated from other microbes.<br><br>23. Erythromycin is produced by Streptomyces erythraea.<br><br>24. Streptomycin is produced by Streptomyces griseus.<br><br>25. A large number of new antibiotics have been discovered to take care of increasing drug resistant microbes.<br><br>26.

Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary treatment and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment steps basically involve physical removal of particles from sewage.<br><br>4. Physical removal in primary treatment includes filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. Particles are removed in stages during primary treatment - large and small particles.<br><br>6. Initially, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>7. Grit consisting of soil and small pebbles are removed by sedimentation.<br><br>8. All solids that settle during primary treatment form the primary sludge.<br><br>9. The supernatant after primary treatment forms the effluent.<br><br>10. The effluent from the primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>11. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>12. The primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>13. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>14. Air is pumped into the aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>15. Mechanical agitation and air pumping allow vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes.<br><br>16. Aerobic microbes grow into flocs during secondary treatment.<br><br>17. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures.<br><br>18. While growing, these microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>19. Microbial growth significantly reduces the BOD of the effluent.<br><br>20.

  }], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector: origin of replication, selectable marker, and cloning sites.<br><br>2. Origin of replication (ori) is a sequence from where replication starts in the vector DNA molecule.<br><br>3. Any piece of DNA when linked to ori sequence can be made to replicate within the host cells through the vector.<br><br>4. The ori sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA in the host cell.<br><br>5. If one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA, it should be cloned in a vector whose origin supports high copy number.<br><br>6. In addition to ori, the vector requires a selectable marker which helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants.<br><br>7. Selectable marker also helps in selectively permitting the growth of the transformants containing the recombinant DNA.<br><br>8. Transformation is a procedure through which a piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium for cloning purposes.<br><br>9. Genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin are considered useful selectable markers for E. coli.<br><br>10. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance against any of these antibiotics, making them suitable for selection.<br><br>11. For cloning sites, the vector needs to have very few, preferably single, recognition sites for the commonly used restriction enzymes.<br><br>12. Presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments, which will complicate the gene cloning process.<br><br>13. The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two antibiotic resistance genes in the vector.<br><br>14. For example, foreign DNA can be ligated at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322.<br><br>15. pBR322 is a modified bacterial plasmid frequently used as a vector for cloning genes in E. coli host cells.<br><br>16. In pBR322, P stands for plasmid, B and R are the names of scientists Boliver and Rodriguez, and 322 is a distinguishing number.<br><br>17. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA at BamH I site in the tet gene.<br><br>18. Recombinant plasmids can still be selected out from non-recombinants by plating transformants on ampicillin containing medium.<br><br>19. Transformants growing on ampicillin medium are then transferred to medium containing tetracycline to distinguish recombinants from non-recombinants.<br><br>20. Non-recombinants will grow on medium containing both antibiotics, while recombinants will only grow on ampicillin medium.<br><br>21. In this selection process, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting transformants while the other helps in identifying recombinants.<br><br>22. Figure 9.4 shows E. coli cloning vector pBR322 with restriction sites (Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I, Sal I, Pvu II, Pst I, Cla I), ori and antibiotic resistance genes.<br><br>23. The pBR322 vector contains ampR (ampicillin resistance gene) and tetR (tetracycline resistance gene) as selectable markers.<br><br>24.

After ice incubation, cells are placed briefly at 42 degree C (heat shock) and then put back on ice to enable bacteria to take up recombinant DNA.<br><br>3. The correct sequence of making cells competent is: treatment with divalent cations then incubation with rDNA on ice then heat shock at 42 degree C then placed on ice.<br><br>4. Heat shock at 42 degree C for brief period increases cell membrane permeability, facilitating DNA uptake by competent bacterial cells.<br><br>5. Micro-injection is a method where recombinant DNA is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell using fine glass pipette.<br><br>6. Biolistics or gene gun is a method suitable for plants where cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA.<br><br>7.

Denaturation is the first step of PCR where DNA is heated at high temperature (94-96 degree C) to separate the two strands of double helix.<br><br>16. Annealing is the second step where two sets of primers anneal to each single-stranded template DNA at temperature 40-60 degree C.<br><br>17.

The enzyme DNA polymerase used in PCR is isolated from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus and is called Taq polymerase.<br><br>3. The DNA polymerase enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template.<br><br>4. If the process of replication of DNA in PCR is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times.<br><br>5. Repeated amplification in PCR is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase isolated from bacterium Thermus aquaticus.<br><br>6. Thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) remains active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA in PCR.<br><br>7. Taq polymerase is a thermostable DNA polymerase used in PCR, not inactive at high temperature as it functions at 72 degree C during extension step.<br><br>8. The thermostable enzymes Taq and Pfu isolated from thermophilic bacteria are DNA polymerases used in PCR applications.<br><br>9. The amplified DNA fragment from PCR can be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning as shown in Figure 9.6.<br><br>10. Section 9.3.4 covers Insertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host Cell/Organism with several methods for introducing ligated DNA.<br><br>11. Recipient cells are made competent to receive and take up DNA present in their surrounding environment through transformation.<br><br>12. If recombinant DNA bearing gene for resistance to antibiotic ampicillin is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells.<br><br>13. When transformed cells are spread on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow while untransformed recipient cells will die.<br><br>14. The ampicillin resistance gene that allows selection of transformed cells in the presence of ampicillin is called a selectable marker.<br><br>15. Useful selectable markers for E. coli include genes for resistance to antibiotics like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin.<br><br>16. Genes encoding proteins that degrade antibiotics would NOT be useful selectable markers as they would allow all cells to survive.<br><br>17. Section 9.3.5 covers Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product as the ultimate aim of most recombinant DNA technologies.<br><br>18. When alien DNA is inserted into cloning vector and transferred into bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA gets multiplied.<br><br>19. In almost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a desirable protein, so the recombinant DNA needs to be expressed.<br><br>20. If any protein encoding gene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a recombinant protein.<br><br>21. Cells harboring cloned genes of interest may be grown on small scale in laboratory for extracting and purifying the desired protein.<br><br>22. Different separation techniques are used for extracting the desired protein and then purifying it from cell cultures.<br><br>23. Cells can be multiplied in continuous culture system where used medium is drained from one side while fresh medium is added from other side.<br><br>24. Downstream processing occurs after the completion of the biosynthetic stage and involves processes that make products ready for marketing.<br><br>25.

}  ], " NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Cells in continuous culture system stay in their active log/exponential phase, maintaining constant growth and productivity.<br><br>2. Continuous culture method produces a larger biomass leading to higher yields of desired proteins compared to batch culture.<br><br>3. A distinct advantage of continuous culture over batch culture is higher productivity with continuous production of proteins.<br><br>4. Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products, necessitating the development of large-scale bioreactors.<br><br>5. To produce in large quantities, bioreactors where large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed were developed.<br><br>6. Bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products like proteins and enzymes.<br><br>7. Bioreactors use microbial, plant, animal or human cells to convert raw materials into desired biotechnological products.<br><br>8. A bioreactor provides optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth rate through controlled parameters.<br><br>9. The optimal conditions provided by bioreactor include temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, and oxygen for cell growth.<br><br>10. The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, shown in Figure 9.7 on this page.<br><br>11. Figure 9.7 shows two types of bioreactors: (a) Simple stirred-tank bioreactor and (b) Sparged stirred tank bioreactor.<br><br>12. A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.<br><br>13. The stirrer in bioreactor facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor for all cells.<br><br>14. In simple stirred tank bioreactor, mixing is done solely by stirring without sparging of air bubbles.<br><br>15. In sparged stirred tank bioreactor, sterile air can be bubbled through the reactor to increase oxygen transfer.<br><br>16. Air bubbles in sparged stirred tank bioreactor dramatically increase the oxygen transfer area for aerobic cell growth.<br><br>17. The role of air bubbles sparged into bioreactor tanks is to increase the surface area for oxygen transfer, not to remove foam.<br><br>18. The bioreactor has an agitator system for mixing, an oxygen delivery system for aeration, and a foam control system.<br><br>19. A bioreactor also has a temperature control system, pH control system, and sampling ports for periodic culture withdrawal.<br><br>20. Sampling ports allow small volumes of the culture to be withdrawn periodically for monitoring growth and product formation.<br><br>21. Section 9.3.6 introduces Downstream Processing as post-biosynthetic processing before marketing the finished product.<br><br>22. After completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected through a series of processes before marketing.<br><br>23. Downstream processing includes separation and purification of the desired product from the bioreactor culture.<br><br>24. Downstream processing occurs after the biosynthetic phase when the product has been produced in the bioreactor.<br><br>25. Separation and purification by filtration, centrifugation of desired compound produced in bioreactor is part of downstream processing only.<br><br>26.

Quality control testing does not include separation and purification steps; these are part of downstream processing.<br><br>12. Downstream processing typically involves three primary areas: cell interruption, decontamination segments, and cleaning segment.<br><br>13. The steps of downstream processing include: removal of insolubles, product isolation, and purification of products.<br><br>14. Insolubles like cell debris are removed from fermentation broth by centrifugation, filtration, sedimentation, or precipitation.<br><br>15. Product isolation involves elimination of elements differing from properties of desired product, mainly water removal.<br><br>16. Purification of products involves separation of contaminants closely imitating the product in physical and chemical properties.<br><br>17. Operations in purification include size exclusion, affinity, ion exchange, reversed-phase chromatography, and crystallization.<br><br>18.

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was largely due to improved crop varieties and better management practices using agrochemicals.<br><br>2. Agrochemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are expensive and often unaffordable for farmers in developing countries, creating economic challenges.<br><br>3. Traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with increasing food demand, leading to development of modern tissue culture techniques in the 1950s.<br><br>4. Tissue culture is the technique of growing whole plants from explants (any part of plant taken out) in test tubes under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>5. Totipotency is the capacity of any cell or explant to generate a complete plant, fundamental principle behind tissue culture success.<br><br>6. Micropropagation is the method of producing thousands of plants in very short durations through tissue culture, enabling rapid plant multiplication.<br><br>7. The nutrient medium for tissue culture must provide a carbon source (sucrose) along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins.<br><br>8. Advantages of micropropagation include propagation of large numbers of plants in short time periods, independent of seasons.<br><br>9. Plants produced through micropropagation are genetically identical to the original plant, creating somaclones.<br><br>10. Food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been successfully produced on commercial scale using micropropagation methods.<br><br>11. Tissue culture can be used to recover healthy plants from diseased ones, even those infected with viruses or systemic pathogens.<br><br>12. Meristem culture is the best method to obtain virus-free plants by growing meristem tissue in vitro to obtain pathogen-free plants.<br><br>13. Scientists have successfully cultured meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato to obtain virus-free plants for commercial production.<br><br>14. Protoplasts are plant cells without cell walls, obtained by enzymatic digestion of cell walls, and can be isolated as single cells.<br><br>15. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties (each having desirable characteristics) can be fused to create hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>16. Somatic hybrids are new plants developed from hybrid protoplasts, and the process is called somatic hybridization.<br><br>17. Hybrid protoplasts surrounded by plasma membranes can be further grown to form a new plant through somatic hybridization technique. "],

  } ], " NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Presence of a pathogen (bacteria, viruses, etc.) is normally suspected very late when the pathogen concentration is already very high in the body.<br><br>2. Very low concentration of bacteria or virus at a time when disease symptoms are not yet visible can be detected by amplification of their nucleic acid by PCR.<br><br>3. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) can amplify a single copy of DNA to detect very low amounts of DNA in samples.<br><br>4. PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients, enabling early diagnosis before symptoms appear.<br><br>5. PCR is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients, making it a powerful technique for cancer diagnosis.<br><br>6. PCR is a powerful technique to identify many other genetic disorders beyond HIV and cancer.<br><br>7. A single stranded DNA or RNA tagged with a radioactive molecule (probe) is allowed to hybridize to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells.<br><br>8. Detection of hybridized probe is done using autoradiography technique which uses photographic film to detect radioactive signals.<br><br>9. The clone having the mutated gene will appear on the photographic film because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.<br><br>10. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay) is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction for disease detection.<br><br>11. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens (proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) produced by the pathogen.<br><br>12. Infection can also be detected by detecting the antibodies synthesized against the pathogen by the host immune system.<br><br>13. Section 10.3 introduces Transgenic Animals - animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra (foreign) gene.<br><br>14. Examples of transgenic animals include transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish produced for various research purposes.<br><br>15. Over 95% of existing transgenic animals are mice, making them the most common model organism for transgenic research.<br><br>16. Transgenic animals are produced to study normal physiology and development by allowing study of how genes are regulated and affect body functions.<br><br>17. Transgenic animals help in study of disease by increasing understanding of how genes contribute to the development of disease.<br><br>18. Transgenic animals serve as models for human diseases enabling investigation of new treatments for various conditions.<br><br>19. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>20. Information obtained from transgenic animals includes biological role of factors and studying biological effects that result from gene expression. "],

Transgenic animals can produce useful biological products by introducing the portion of DNA coding for a particular product into their genome.<br><br>3. Human protein α-1-antitrypsin is used to treat emphysema and can be produced using transgenic animals for cost-effective production.<br><br>4. Similar attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis using transgenic animal-derived biological products.<br><br>5. In 1997, the first transgenic cow named Rosie produced human protein-enriched milk containing human alpha-lactalbumin.<br><br>6. The milk from transgenic cow Rosie contained 2.4 grams per litre of human alpha-lactalbumin protein.<br><br>7. Milk from Rosie was nutritionally a more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk due to human alpha-lactalbumin content.<br><br>8. Transgenic mice are being developed for use in testing the safety of vaccines before using them on humans.<br><br>9. Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine before human administration.<br><br>10. Transgenic rabbits and monkeys are also used to test the safety of batches of vaccines for quality control purposes.<br><br>11. Chemical safety testing is also known as toxicity testing or safety testing of drugs and toxic substances.<br><br>12. The purpose of toxicity testing is to determine the safety of drugs before they are used for human treatment.<br><br>13. Transgenic animals for toxicity testing are made that carry genes which make them more sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals.<br><br>14. These sensitive transgenic animals are exposed to the toxic substances and the effects are studied for safety assessment.<br><br>15. Toxicity testing in transgenic animals allows us to obtain results in less time compared to conventional testing methods.<br><br>16. Section 10.4 on Ethical Issues discusses that manipulation of living organisms by humans cannot go on without regulation.<br><br>17. Some ethical standards are required to evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living organisms.<br><br>18. Genetic modification of organisms can have unpredictable results when such organisms are introduced into the ecosystem.<br><br>19. The Indian Government has set up GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee) to make decisions regarding validity of GM research.<br><br>20. GEAC makes decisions regarding the safety of introducing GM organisms for public services like food and medicine sources.<br><br>21. The modification and usage of living organisms for public services has raised problems with patents granted for biological resources.<br><br>22. There is growing public anger that companies are granted patents for products using genetic materials developed by farmers and indigenous people. "],

How Questions - Mechanism: How questions seek the mechanism behind the process. Example: How does the bird sing? Answer lies in operation of voice box and sound production mechanisms.<br><br>5. Why Questions - Significance: Why questions seek the significance of the process. Example: Why does the bird sing?

Population Definition: A population is a group of individuals of the same species mainly sharing or competing for similar resources, potentially interbreeding and thus constitute a real discrete and identifiable unit.<br><br>2. Population Examples: All cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond are examples of populations.<br><br>3. Population Attributes: A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess - birth rates, death rates, sex ratio and age distribution.<br><br>4. Birth Rate Calculation: If in a pond there are 20 lotus plants last year and through reproduction 8 new plants are added, the birth rate or natality is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>5. Death Rate Calculation: If 3 plants died during the year out of initial 20, the death rate or mortality is 3 divided by 20 equals 0.15 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>6. Sex Ratio Definition: An individual may be a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio. Example: 60 percent of population are females and 40 percent males gives ratio 60:40 or 3:2.<br><br>7. Age Distribution: Age composition or age distribution is another attribute of a population referring to the percentage of individuals of different age groups.<br><br>8. Age Pyramid: When percentage of individuals of a given age or age group is plotted for the population, the resulting structure is called the age pyramid.<br><br>9. Age Pyramid Shapes: The shape of the age pyramid reflects the growth status - triangular shape indicates expanding population, bell shape indicates stable population, urn shape indicates declining population.<br><br>10.

Age Pyramid Shapes: Figure 13.1 shows three types of age pyramids - expanding (triangular base), stable (bell-shaped) and declining (urn-shaped) indicating growth status of population.<br><br>2. Population Density Symbol: Population size is technically called population density and is designated as N.<br><br>3. Measurement Units: Population density need not necessarily be measured in numbers only. For terrestrial organisms it is measured as individuals per square meter (m²).<br><br>4. Biomass Measurement: In some cases, population density is more meaningfully measured in terms of biomass rather than numbers. Example: A single Banyan tree with large canopy has more biomass than 200 carrot grass plants.<br><br>5. Ecological Significance: The ecological effects of any species depend not merely on its absolute numbers but on how dense it is or on its size in relation to available resources.<br><br>6. Four Basic Processes: Population density in a given habitat during a given period fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes - Natality, Mortality, Immigration and Emigration.<br><br>7. Natality: The total number of births during a given period in a population. It contributes to increase in population density.<br><br>8. Mortality: The total number of deaths during a given period in a population. It contributes to decrease in population density.<br><br>9. Immigration: Number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere. It increases population density.<br><br>10. Emigration: Number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere. It decreases population density.<br><br>11. Population Change Formula: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)], where B is births, I is immigrants, D is deaths and E is emigrants.<br><br>12.

Four Factors Affecting Population: Population density is affected by four basic processes - Natality (B), Mortality (D), Immigration (I), and Emigration (E).<br><br>2. Natality Definition: Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. It contributes to increase in population density.<br><br>3. Mortality Definition: Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. It contributes to decrease in population density.<br><br>4. Immigration Definition: Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It increases population density.<br><br>5. Emigration Definition: Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration. It decreases population density.<br><br>6. Population Density Formula: If N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t + 1 is: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)].<br><br>7. Population Increase Condition: Population density will increase if the number of births plus immigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus emigrants (D + E).<br><br>8. Normal Conditions: Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors influencing population density. Immigration and Emigration assume importance only under special conditions.<br><br>9. Special Conditions: If a new habitat is just being colonized, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.<br><br>10.

The population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.<br><br>2. Darwin's Observation: Darwin observed exponential growth while developing his theory of natural selection, noting that populations have the ability to grow rapidly when resources are unlimited.<br><br>3. Growth Rate Formula: If birth rate per capita is b and death rate per capita is d, then the rate of change in population dN/dt = (b - d) × N.<br><br>4. Simplified Form: Let (b - d) = r, then dN/dt = rN, where r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>5. Intrinsic Rate (r): The r in the equation is called the intrinsic rate of natural increase and is a very important parameter for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.<br><br>6. r Values Examples: For Norway rat, r = 0.015. For human population in 1981, r value was 0.0205. In 1981, what the current r value is for calculating it, you need to know the birth and death rates.<br><br>7. J-shaped Curve: Exponential growth results in a J-shaped curve when population size (N) is plotted against time. This indicates unlimited resources.<br><br>8. Integral Form Equation: Using integral calculus, the exponential growth equation is Nt = N0 e^rt, where Nt is population after time t, N0 is initial population, r is intrinsic rate, and e is base of natural logarithms (2.71828).<br><br>9. Rapid Growth Potential: Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.<br><br>10. Exponential vs Logistic: When resources are not limiting, growth plot is exponential (J-shaped). When resources are limiting, growth is logistic (S-shaped) with carrying capacity K. "],

Four Phases of Logistic Growth: A population growing in a habitat with limited resources shows initially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration and finally an asymptote.<br><br>5. Asymptote Definition: When the population density reaches the carrying capacity, it reaches asymptote phase. Asymptote is obtained when K equals N.<br><br>6. Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth: This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth and produces a sigmoid curve.<br><br>7. Logistic Growth Equation: The equation is dN/dt = rN[(K-N)/K], where N is population density at time t, r is intrinsic rate of natural increase, and K is carrying capacity.<br><br>8. Carrying Capacity (K): K represents the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely with available resources.<br><br>9. Growth Limiting Factor: The factor [(K-N)/K] represents the fraction of carrying capacity available for further growth. When N approaches K, this factor approaches zero, slowing growth.<br><br>10. Maximum Growth Rate: In logistic growth, the population growth rate is maximum when N equals K/2, which is the inflection point of the S-shaped curve.<br><br>11.

Pyramid of Energy Always Upright: Pyramid of energy is always upright and can never be inverted because when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level, some energy is always lost as heat at each step.<br><br>2. Energy Loss at Each Level: At each trophic level, energy is lost through respiration, metabolic activities, heat dissipation, and other processes. Only about 10% energy is transferred to next level.<br><br>3. Unidirectional Energy Flow: Energy flow in an ecosystem is unidirectional.
